# Golconda-thesis
A smart contract for trustless charitable crowdfunding

The purpose of this work is to explore the basic principles of smart contract and dapp development as well as issues that must be regarded during development such as security and operational cost optimization. Weâ€™ll take a deeper look into the technical aspects of Ethereum and how they impact design choices on front-end and back-end development. Meanwhile, as an example we will develop a smart contract powered application that allows trustless crowdfunding for charitable causes, named Golconda. This application will be created using traditional software design methodologies to point out how Ethereum-powered application development is similar in some cases and different in others. Finally, we will propose a roadmap that could lead to mainstream adoption of the application, explore how an ICO could be executed and how it could eventually transform into a Dao by embedding a business plan in its code.
